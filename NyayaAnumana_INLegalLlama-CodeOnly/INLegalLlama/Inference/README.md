# Inference Evaluation
The final models, derived from both the Continued PreTraining and Supervised Fine-Tuning phases, are assessed for their inference capabilities. Evaluation is performed using two distinct datasets:
- PREDEX_TEST
- ILDC Expert Data

These datasets are organized into separate folders specific to each dataset for clarity and ease of access.
